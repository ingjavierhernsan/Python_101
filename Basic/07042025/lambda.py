# LAMBDA
# A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

# Syntax
# lambda arguments : expresion

# Add 10 to argument a, and return the result:

x = lambda a : a + 10
print(x(5))

# Lambda functions can take any number of arguments:

x = lambda a, b : a * b
print(x(5,6))

# Summarize argument a, b, and c and return the result:

x = lambda a, b, c : a + b + c
print(x(5, 6, 2))

# Why use lambda functions?
# The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.
# Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied with and unknown number:

def myfunc(n):
    return lambda a : a * n

# Use that function definition to make a function that always doubles the number you send in:

def myfunc(n):
    return lambda a : a * n

mydoubler = myfunc(2)

print(mydoubler(11))

# Or, use the same function definition to make a function that always triples the number you send in:

def myfunc(n):
    return lambda a : a * n

mytripler = myfunc(3)

print(mytripler(11))

# Or, use the same function definition to make both functions, in the same program:

def myfunc(n):
    return lambda a : a * n

mydoubler = myfunc(2)
mytripler = myfunc(3)

print(mydoubler(11))
print(mytripler(11))

# Use lambda functions when an anonymous function is required for a short period of time.
